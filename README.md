# Gold Digger: A Pathfinding Visualizer
This project is an interactive 2D web application that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms in a customizable grid environment. Navigate a procedurally generated maze as a gold digger, exploring the map and collecting all the gold.

## Features
Algorithm Visualization</u>: Watch as popular pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) find the optimal path in real-time.

<u>Customizable Grid</u>: Create and edit maps by drawing walls, adding obstacles, and setting different terrain costs.

<u>*Dynamic Grid Sizing</u>: The grid automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

<u>*Interactive Controls</u>: Use drag-and-drop to create and edit your maze.

<u>*Single-File Architecture</u>: The entire application runs from a single HTML file, making it easy to share, view, and run locally without any setup.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using a minimal web stack for simplicity and performance:

<u>*HTML</u>: For the core structure of the web application.

<u>*CSS</u>: For all the styling.

<u>*JavaScript</u>: For all the game logic, rendering, and algorithms.
