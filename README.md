# Gold Digger: A Pathfinding Visualizer
This project is an interactive 2D web application that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms in a customizable grid environment. Navigate a procedurally generated maze as a gold digger, exploring the map and collecting all the gold.

## Features
Algorithm Visualization: Watch as popular pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra's, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) find the optimal path in real-time.

* Customizable Grid<: Create and edit maps by drawing walls, adding obstacles, and setting different terrain costs.

* Dynamic Grid Sizing: The grid automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

* Interactive Controls: Use drag-and-drop to create and edit your maze.

* Single-File Architecture: The entire application runs from a single HTML file, making it easy to share, view, and run locally without any setup.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using a minimal web stack for simplicity and performance:

* HTML: For the core structure of the web application.

* CSS: For all the styling.

* JavaScript: For all the game logic, rendering, and algorithms.
